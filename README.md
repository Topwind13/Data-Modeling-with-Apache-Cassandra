# Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

This project is part of the Data Engineering with Azure Nanodegree from Udacity. The objective is to **build an ETL Pipeline** with the following sub-objectives:

1. Implement the logic in section Part I of the notebook template to iterate through each event file in `event_data` to process and create a new CSV file in Python
2. Make necessary edits to Part II of the notebook template to include Apache Cassandra `CREATE` and `INSERT` statements to load processed records into relevant tables in your data model
3. Test by running `SELECT` statements after running the queries on your database
